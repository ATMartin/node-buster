node-buster
===========

I discovered [Buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana), and decided I would try to port it over to Node as a learning experience. This is the result of my attempts. 

I have a newfound appreciation for Python. This is definitely not suited to Node, but I'm determined to get it sort of working! 

TODO: Refactor. Everything. Consider a REPL-style input, instead of if-else & callbacks?
